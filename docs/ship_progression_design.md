## TOOL STACKING EXAMPLES

**Early Game Setup (Scout Class, 1 slot)**
- Precision Cutter: +10% yield, +5% rare
- Total: 10% more output, slightly better rare element chances

**Mid Game Setup (Prospector Class, 2 slots)**
- Precision Cutter + Resonance Probe
- Total: +15% yield, +15% rare element bonus
- Good all-around setup

**Aggressive Setup (Harvester Class, 3 slots)**
- Power Hammer + Power Hammer + Diamond Saw
- Total: +75% yield (but high power cost)
- Fast credit accumulation

**Efficiency Setup (Harvester Class, 3 slots)**
- Element Separator + Element Separator + Molecular Extractor
- Total: +40% yield, 100% of mined materials auto-refined
- Less manual work, lower power cost

**Endgame Rare Hunting (Titan Class, 4 slots)**
- Void Resonator + Resonance Probe + Deep Scanner + Platinum Analyzer
- Total: +40% yield, +35% rare bonus, reveals asteroids, highest exotic chance
- Hunting for new elements

## POWER SYSTEM

**Power Cell** runs out during mining. Recharges between asteroids.
- Each tool adds power cost
- Running out of power = mining fails (resources lost)
- Higher ship levels = more power to burn

**Example**:
- Scout with Precision Cutter: 10% power cost per mining cycle
- Harvester with 3x Power Hammers: 90% power cost (risky!)
- Titan with balanced setup: 45% power cost (sustainable)

## PROGRESSION FLOW

```
SCOUT CLASS (Start)
   ↓ Collect ~2,000 credits
PROSPECTOR CLASS (more slots, medium asteroids)
   ↓ Collect ~8,000 credits
HARVESTER CLASS (all asteroids, 3 slots)
   ↓ Collect ~25,000 credits
INDUSTRIAL CLASS (dual mining)
   ↓ Collect ~75,000 credits
TITAN CLASS (endgame god-tier)
```

**Tool Progression** runs parallel:
- Start: Standard Drill (free)
- Early: Buy Precision Cutter or Resonance Probe (500-700 cr)
- Mid: Add Diamond Saw or Element Separator (2000-3000 cr)
- Late: Get Plasma Cutter or Void Resonator (8000-12000 cr)

## DESIGN NOTES

**Balancing**:
- More yield = higher power cost (risk/reward)
- Rare element tools are expensive (justifies cost)
- Multiple tool types allow different playstyles (speed vs. efficiency vs. quality)

**Progression Pacing**:
- Scout → Prospector: ~15 min gameplay
- Prospector → Harvester: ~30 min gameplay
- Harvester → Industrial: ~1 hour gameplay
- Industrial → Titan: ~2+ hour gameplay (true endgame)

**Meaningful Choices**:
- Do you unlock the next ship or buy better tools first?
- Do you spec for yield or for rare elements?
- Risk high power cost for max yield?
